Here is an overview of what I want to cover in module02.

Okay. I want to get you started using SAS. It's either going to be really easy or it's going to be really really hard. I want to give you as much guidance as I can without staring over your shoulder. Just quickly, I wrote this PowerPoint presentation and all the PowerPoint presentations using R Markdown. If you are curious I have a repository. It has some beautiful output.

Greetings! My name is Steve Simon and I am the instructor for the class, MEDB 5507, Introduction to SAS.
