## 05-05

::: notes

This is very odd. You can get a hint as 
to why smokers might have higher fev values than
non-smokers by looking at how height and smoking
status are related.

Smokers are taller than 
non-smokers, and by quite a bit.

These statistics show the same
trend. It is obvious that smoking is confined to
mostly older children. And since the older
children are bigger, that may explain the odd
relationship we saw earlier. You should also
examine the relationship between sex and fev.
Do this on your own, but there is no need to 
turn anything in. ;
