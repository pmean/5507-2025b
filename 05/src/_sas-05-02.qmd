## Descriptive statistics

-   Use proc freq to look for 
    -   Inconsistencies
    -   Rare/missing category levels
-   Use proc means to look for 
    -   Unusual minimum/maximum values
    -   Zero standard deviation
    
::: notes

There is a mix of categorical and 
continuous variables in this data set.
Recall that you use proc freq for 
categorical variables and proc means
for continuous variables. 

Always get in the habit of checking 
for missing values.

Look for problems. This could mean
a lot more categories than you 
expected, a particular category level
that is unexpectedly small, or multiple
categories caused by misspelling or 
inconsistent capitalization. There are
no problems here.

Look for minimum or maximum values 
that are unusual. Also make sure that you don't have
a continuous variable that is constant (zero
variation).
