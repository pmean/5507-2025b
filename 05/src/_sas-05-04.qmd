## 05-04

::: notes

When you want to look at a relationship
between a categorical variable and a continuous
variable, you should use a boxplot. Notice that
you use proc sgplot for both a scatterplot and a 
boxplot. This is a big improvement over previous
methods in SAS to produce plots because it is 
easier to learn one procedure and minor variations
in that procedure rather than having to learn
multiple procedures.

The bottom and top of the boxplot
represents the 25th and 75th percentiles,
respectively. A thin line, or whisker, is drawn
down to the minimum value and up to the maximum
value. Extreme values are shown as individual
data points. Notice the discrepancy in fev.
Smokers seem to have a much higher FEV than
non-smokers. This is quite surprising.;

* Notes10. Also look at how the means and standard
deviations of your continuous variable change for
each level of your categorical variable.

Output, page 8. Notice again the discrepancy in 
fev by smoking status. This is quite surprising.;
