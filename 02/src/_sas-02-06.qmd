## Historial sidenote, IBM mainframe printer

![](../images/ibm-mainfame-printer.png)

::: notes

When I was in graduate school, SAS would only print to a large printer attached to the IBM mainframe computer. I don't know the exact model, but it did look something like this. 

This printer was fast, probably faster than many of today's printers. But it has a limited character set, mostly just the things you would find on a manual typewriter. It could only print in one color, black. And it could only use a fixed width font, not too much different that what you see today with the Courier New font.

This led to some serious compromises that you had to make with

## Historical sidenote, Sample output from proc plot

::: notes

Here's an example of output from proc plot. It's actually a bit better than what I had in graduate school because this graph is using some of the box drawing characters that cam with the IBM personal computers.

::: notes

The box drawing characters allowed you to place a single line frame, a double line frame, or a thick frame around other text, and it looked pretty cool. Before box drawing characters, you had just three characters for drawing frames. The vertical bar was used for the Y axis, the minus sign for the X axis, and the plus sign for corners and tick marks.

## Historical side note, Pen plotter

[![](../images/pen-plotter.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W1_MsGS14E)

::: notes

There were pen plotters back then. It worked kind of like an etch-a-sketch. One part of the pen plotter moved the paper in a vertical direction, and the pen slid back and forth in a horizontal direction. It was a lot of fun to watch.

The pen plotter allowed you to use multiple colors, but limited typically to four, six, or eight different pens. It also allowed you to draw diagonal lines and curves.

The interesting thing about the pen plotter was when you have a lot of data points overlapping. The pen plotter would put so much ink down that parts of the paper would get soaked and start to tear.

## Historical note, Dot matrix printer

![](../images/dot-matrix-printer-output.png)

## Today's technology, Ink jet or laser printer

-   300 dots per inch or better
-   Up to 16.7 million colors
    -   CMYK system versus RGB system

::: notes

Today, most statistical graphs are printed using ink jet or laser technology. Starting with the Apple LaserWriter in 1985, laser printer technology allowed for very precise graphs with fine details.

## Today's technology, 3D printers (SAS does not support these)

![](../images/3d-printer-output.png)

::: notes

As far as I know, you cannot use SAS to create solid objects using a 3D printer. It is possible to do this in R, but it is not easy. I expect this to become possible and easy for both R and SAS in the near future.

## Drawing histograms

-   Histograms can assess normality/non-normality
    -   Skewness
    -   Bimodal distributions
    -   Outliers
-   How many bars? Multiple recommendations
    -   Five to twenty bars
    -   Square root of n bars
    -   Trial and error

::: notes

A histogram can help you assess the distributional pattern of your data. Is it normally distributed (the classical bell shaped curve)? If so, you can make fairly strong assumptions about the data. The mean plus or minus one standard deviation will contain roughly 68% of the data. The mean plus or minus two standard deviations will contain roughly 95% of the data.

Normality is also an assumption needed for a variety of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. It is not a life-or-death assumption, especially when your sample size is large. Also, the normality assumption is often better assessed using residuals from your statistical model.

The other nice thing about the histogram is that it can identify what type of deviation from normality you might have. Identifying bimodality is the trickiest, because if you have too few bars you might miss the gap between modes. If you have too many bars, you might see multiple modes because of the spikiness that is artificially produced when you have too many bars.

There is no simple rule for deciding how many bars you should have in your histogram. Once sources suggests that 5 to 20 is a reasonable number of bars. Another suggests that the number of bars should be roughly equal to the square root of the sample size. To be honest, the best approach might be to try several different choices and see which one gives a reasonable picture of the distribution of your variable.
