sas <- chunk_sas("simon-5507-03-demo-05-string-data.sas")
text_data <- read_lines("../data/text-with-strings.txt")

## A file with strings

```{r}
#| label: 03-05-text

cat(text_data, sep="\n")
```

::: notes

This is the same artificial dataset, with no delimiters. There are a few stray blanks, but only because some of the numbers are one digit instead of two or two digits instead of three.

`r sas[1]`

`r sas[2]`
