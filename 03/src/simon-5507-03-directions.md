## General directions

-   Adapt the various programs available in the [03/src folder][ref-simon-src] of my github repository. 

## Add code to answer the following questions

-   Q1. Download the file [energy01.csv][ref-simon-energy01] and read it into SAS. Print the first three rows of data. Use the [data dictionary][ref-simon-dictionary01], if needed.
-   Q2. Download the file [energy02.tsv][ref-simon-energy02] and read it into SAS. Print the first three rows of data. Use the [data dictionary][ref-simon-dictionary02], if needed.
-   Q3. Download the file [energy03.txt][ref-simon-energy03] and read it into SAS. Print the first three rows of data. Use the [data dictionary][ref-simon-dictionary03], if needed.
-   Q4. Download the file [energy04.csv][ref-simon-energy04] and read it into SAS. Print the first three rows of data. Use the [data dictionary][ref-simon-dictionary04], if needed.
-   List your name, the date, and the version of SAS as a footnote for all programs.

## Error messages
